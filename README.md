# AgentFlow

AgentFlow is a local-first AI workforce orchestration platform for coordinating specialized AI workers, runtimes, workflows, tasks, approvals, evaluations, and traceable artifacts.

The V0.1 architecture is frozen. This repository is a TypeScript pnpm + Turborepo monorepo; package implementations are owned by the task cards in `docs/planning/02-development-task-backlog.md`.

## Toolchain

| Tool            | Pin                                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js         | `>=22` (`.nvmrc` is `22` LTS; Node 22 and 24 are both fine for local development) |
| Package manager | pnpm `9.4.0` (`packageManager` field; do not use npm or yarn)                     |
| Orchestration   | Turborepo                                                                         |
| Language        | TypeScript, strict                                                                |
| Test            | Vitest                                                                            |
| Lint / format   | ESLint + Prettier                                                                 |

## Development commands

Run from the repository root after a clean checkout:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm format          # rewrite with Prettier
pnpm format:check    # CI check; does not write
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

One-click local Desktop (dev): double-click `start.cmd` on Windows, or run `./start.sh` / `node tooling/scripts/start-desktop.mjs`. The launcher checks Node.js `>=22`, then runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` when root `node_modules` is missing **or workspace links are stale** (a package.json `workspace:*` dependency with no on-disk link). That gap is a common Daemon `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` crash after a pull. `pnpm check:workspace-links` reports the same gaps without launching. Then the launcher starts `@workforce/desktop` `dev`. Electron shows a window and starts the loopback Daemon; close the window to stop. This is not a packaged installer and does not enable live Codex exec. `node tooling/scripts/start-desktop.mjs --dry-run` only prints the planned command. `pnpm --filter @workforce/desktop dev` skips this check; use `start.cmd` / `start.sh` after pulling.

Restarting: use `restart.cmd` / `./restart.sh`, which runs `node tooling/scripts/stop-desktop.mjs` first. Closing the console or killing the parent process can orphan the Vite dev server, the Electron window and the Daemon; those leftovers keep holding the dev-server port and the Electron single-instance lock, so the next launch either fails on `Port 5173 is already in use` or silently focuses nothing. `stop-desktop.mjs` ends only processes whose command line proves they belong to this repository (and, for the dev server, whose HTTP response is this repo's `apps/desktop/index.html`), so a Vite server from another checkout on the same machine is never touched. `--dry-run` lists the plan without killing, `--keep-daemon` stops the UI and dev server but leaves the loopback Daemon running. Nothing on disk is removed: state files, SQLite data and git worktrees are untouched.

`pnpm test` runs unit tests, the M3 Mock HTTP integration, and a **headless happy-dom page driver** for the project main path (create → plan → confirm → start against the composed Mock daemon). That is not a real Electron window and does not replace headed human click-through. It is not a live Codex proof.

Electron is **not** launched by default. An opt-in helper scripts the same page selectors via `executeJavaScript`; a human is still required for a true window (native directory dialog, SSE / Run console, visual checks):

```bash
pnpm --filter @workforce/desktop smoke
# show the window while the helper runs:
WORKFORCE_DESKTOP_SMOKE_HEADED=1 pnpm --filter @workforce/desktop smoke
```

`pnpm --filter @workforce/desktop dev` always shows the native directory picker. The helper skips that dialog only when `WORKFORCE_DESKTOP_SMOKE=1` is set. Details: `docs/planning/03-implementation-status.md`.

## Workspace layout

```text
apps/desktop                 Electron + Vite + React shell and P0 pages
apps/daemon                  V0.1 local composition: loopback Fastify + Application + SQLite + Local Node Host. This is not a future standalone Control Plane.
packages/*                   Shared libraries (protocol, application, database, ui, …)
runtimes/mock                Mock runtime adapter (wired in daemon composition)
runtimes/codex               Detect/validate + injected Process start/stream/cancel; live exec not claimed
templates/software-development-team
tooling/eslint               Shared ESLint config + boundary test
tooling/typescript           Shared tsconfig presets
tests/contract|integration|e2e|platform
```

Every workspace package is `private: true`, named `@workforce/<id>`, and publishes only the paths listed in its `exports` map. Import `@workforce/domain`, never `../../packages/domain/src/...`.

## Package ownership

Matches `docs/planning/decision-register.md` §4. After this skeleton, package source belongs to the listed task; lockfile and new third-party dependencies stay with T01 / the coordinator.

Public type gaps: send a contract-change request. Do not copy types or edit a neighboring module.

## Browser / Node boundary

`packages/ui` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer` must not import Node built-ins (`node:fs`, `fs`, `path`, and other `node:*` modules).

- TypeScript: those trees use the browser tsconfig (`types: []`, DOM lib only).
- ESLint: `no-restricted-imports` in `@workforce/eslint-config`.
- Proof: `tooling/eslint/node-boundary.test.ts` lints a `node:fs` import as if it lived in `packages/ui` and the renderer, and expects the rule to fail.

## Package `exports` (T02 entry)

Each package currently exports a single public path:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./src/index.ts",
      "default": "./src/index.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

T02 should treat `packages/protocol` as the executable schema source.

To add schema files:

1. Put modules under `packages/protocol/src/` (recommended: `src/schemas/`).
2. Re-export from `packages/protocol/src/index.ts`, **or** add a dedicated public path in `packages/protocol/package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "exports": {
       ".": "./src/index.ts",
       "./schemas": "./src/schemas/index.ts"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Consumers import `@workforce/protocol` or `@workforce/protocol/schemas` only. Do not deep-import `src/internal`.
4. JSON Schema / DTO / OpenAPI generation stays inside `packages/protocol`. Other packages depend on the generated public exports.
5. New third-party dependencies need a lockfile change from T01 / the coordinator.

The same `exports` rule applies to `domain`, `runtime-spi`, `application` ports, `events` contracts, and `testkit` contracts.

## Status

M3 Mock loop is wired in the daemon composition root (create → mock plan fixture → confirm → mock developer runs → artifact approval; restart does not duplicate runs). The desktop app has an Electron/React shell and P0 feature pages. Codex live exec is not enabled. Progress: [docs/planning/03-implementation-status.md](docs/planning/03-implementation-status.md).
